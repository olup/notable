## About This Fork

This repository, maintained by **Ethran**, is a personal project based on the original [olup/notable](https://github.com/olup/notable) repository.  
The base repository has been inactive for over a year, and this fork introduces updates and features tailored to my specific needs and preferences.

### What's New in This Fork?
- Semi-active development with regular updates.
- Personal features and optimizations that make the app more functional for my use.
- Pre-release builds with experimental features and enhancements.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Please note: Since this is a personal project, the features and updates reflect what I find useful. However, feedback and suggestions are welcome!
